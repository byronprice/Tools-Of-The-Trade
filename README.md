# Tools-Of-The-Trade
Jupyter notebook, raw data, and Arduino code for June 2018 GPN Tools of the Trade with incoming class

## General Information
On June 3, 2018, I made some recordings with a mouse that had been implanted on Thursday May 30. I implanted three different ground electrodes, one in M1 (stereotaxic coordinates: bregma +1.0mm, saggital suture -1.5mm), one in S1 (bregma -0.5mm, saggital suture -2.0mm), and one in the cerebellum (bregma -6.0mm, saggital suture -1.0mm). The recording electrode is a 300-500kOhm microelectrode that was placed at a depth of 450microns in binocular primary visual cortex (lamboidal suture +0.5mm, saggital suture +3.1mm). The mouse saw the same 0.05 cycles/degree full-field, phase-reversing sinusoidal grating 4 times with breaks in between. Each time, I changed out the ground electrode: 1- M1, 2- S1, 3- Cerebellum, 4- all three shorted against each other. 

## Arduino
Get the open-source code for the Arduino here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software . Once you have it, you can download my .ino files, which contain code to tell the Arduino what to do with an LED. Finally, you connect the Arduino and upload the code onto it.
