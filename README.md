# Tools-Of-The-Trade
Jupyter notebook, raw data, and Arduino code for June 2018 GPN Tools of the Trade with incoming class

## in vivo Electrophysiology
I did some electrophysiology recordings with a mouse that had been implanted a few weeks prior. I implanted one ground electrode in S1 (bregma -0.5mm, saggital suture +2.0mm). The recording electrode is a 300-500kOhm microelectrode that was placed at a depth of 450microns in binocular primary visual cortex (lamboidal suture +0.5mm, saggital suture +3.1mm). The mouse sat passively and viewed a gray screen while I recorded its movement.

## Arduino
Get the open-source code for the Arduino here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software . Once you have it, you can download my .ino files, which contain code to tell the Arduino what to do with an LED. Finally, you connect the Arduino and upload the code onto it.
